# Foreword
This is my first big project in Python. My goal is to code an application in order to play blackjack.
## How to play Blackjack
You play against the bank. Your goal is to have a better score than the bank without exceeding 21. An ace has a value of one or 11 : 1 when you have an ace in your hand and your hit or when you stand and your hand is higher than 10 ; 11 when you stand if you hand is lower than 11<br/></br>
First, the bank gives 2 cards to him and each players. You can only see the first card of the bank for now. Then, you can hit a card and try to do the highest score possible without exceeding 21 or you can stand if you think that your hand is enough to win against the bank.</br>
Then, it's bank's turn. It must stand at 17 and hit at 16.
## How to play
Use your favorite command-line interface and write this : `python3 blackjack.py`</br>
Write h to hit a card, s to stand or q when you wnat to quit the game.</br>
Good luck
## Possible improvement
* Use classes
* Graphical improvement for better lisibility :
  * display cards
  * clear screen
 * Apply probabilities to blackjack
 * Use statistics to learn what's the best stategy
 * Add bets
